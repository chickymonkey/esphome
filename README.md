**ESPHome ESP32-S3 Box 3**

This project is based on the official ESPHome Wake Word Voice Assistant example: https://github.com/esphome/wake-word-voice-assistants/blob/main/esp32-s3-box-3/esp32-s3-box-3.yaml

**Overview**

The goal of this configuration is to extend the ESP32-S3 Box 3 into a smart home control station — not just a voice assistant.

**It includes:**

A custom home (idle) page with four icons, visually designed by Sora.

Additional control and automation functions layered on top of the voice assistant features.
